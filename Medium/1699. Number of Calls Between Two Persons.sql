Table: Calls

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| from_id     | int     |
| to_id       | int     |
| duration    | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table does not have a primary key (column with unique values), it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the duration of a phone call between from_id and to_id.
from_id != to_id
 

Write a solution to report the number of calls and the total call duration between each pair of distinct persons (person1, person2) where person1 < person2.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Calls table:
+---------+-------+----------+
| from_id | to_id | duration |
+---------+-------+----------+
| 1       | 2     | 59       |
| 2       | 1     | 11       |
| 1       | 3     | 20       |
| 3       | 4     | 100      |
| 3       | 4     | 200      |
| 3       | 4     | 200      |
| 4       | 3     | 499      |
+---------+-------+----------+
Output: 
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
| person1 | person2 | call_count | total_duration |
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
| 1       | 2       | 2          | 70             |
| 1       | 3       | 1          | 20             |
| 3       | 4       | 4          | 999            |
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
Explanation: 
Users 1 and 2 had 2 calls and the total duration is 70 (59 + 11).
Users 1 and 3 had 1 call and the total duration is 20.
Users 3 and 4 had 4 calls and the total duration is 999 (100 + 200 + 200 + 499).

-- solution:
select from_id as person1, to_id as person2, count(duration) as call_count,
sum(duration) as total_duration
from((select if (from_id, to_id, from_id)  as from_id, 
if(to_id, from_id, to_id) as to_id, 
duration
from Calls
where from_id > to_id)
UNION ALL
(select *
from Calls
where from_id < to_id)) temp
group by from_id, to_id
