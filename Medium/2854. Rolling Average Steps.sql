Table: Steps

+-------------+------+ 
| Column Name | Type | 
+-------------+------+ 
| user_id     | int  | 
| steps_count | int  |
| steps_date  | date |
+-------------+------+
(user_id, steps_date) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains user_id, steps_count, and steps_date.
Write a solution to calculate 3-day rolling averages of steps for each user.

We calculate the n-day rolling average this way:

For each day, we calculate the average of n consecutive days of step counts ending on that day if available, otherwise, n-day rolling average is not defined for it.
Output the user_id, steps_date, and rolling average. Round the rolling average to two decimal places.

Return the result table ordered by user_id, steps_date in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation: 
- For user id 1, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-06 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (395 + 499 + 712) / 3 = 535.33.
- For user id 1, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-07 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (499 + 712 + 576) / 3 = 595.67.
- For user id 2, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-08 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (153 + 171 + 530) / 3 = 284.67.
- For user id 3, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-09 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (120 + 557 + 840) / 3 = 505.67.
- For user id 3, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-10 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (557 + 840 + 627) / 3 = 674.67.
- For user id 4 and 5, the calculation of the rolling average is not viable as there is insufficient data for the consecutive three days. Output table ordered by user_id and steps_date in ascending order.
