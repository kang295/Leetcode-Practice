+---------------+---------+
post_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row in this table indicates that some post was removed due to being reported or as a result of an admin review.
 

Write a solution to find the average daily percentage of posts that got removed after being reported as spam, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
Removals table:
+---------+-------------+
| post_id | remove_date |
+---------+-------------+
| 2       | 2019-07-20  |
| 3       | 2019-07-18  |
+---------+-------------+
Output: 
+-----------------------+
| average_daily_percent |
+-----------------------+
| 75.00                 |
+-----------------------+
Explanation: 
The percentage for 2019-07-04 is 50% because only one post of two spam reported posts were removed.
The percentage for 2019-07-02 is 100% because one post was reported as spam and it was removed.
The other days had no spam reports so the average is (50 + 100) / 2 = 75%
Note that the output is only one number and that we do not care about the remove dates.
*/

-- solution:
select round((sum(daily_avg) / count(date))*100,2) as average_daily_percent
from (select 
    t.action_date as date,
    (count(distinct case when remove_date is not null then post_id else null end)/count(distinct post_id)) as daily_avg
FROM
(SELECT a.post_id, a.action_date, r.remove_date
from Actions a left join Removals r
on a.post_id = r.post_id
WHERE a.extra='spam') t
GROUP BY t.action_date) t2
